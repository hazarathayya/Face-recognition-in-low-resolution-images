# Face-recognition-in-low-resolution-images
To recognize faces when they are captured in surveilance cameras or body worn cameras. we used SRGANS for improving the resolution of images then perform face recognition upon them.


### Things to try:
1. Using a larger network?
2. Better normalization with BatchNorm
3. Different learning rate (is there a better one?)
4. Change the architecture of CNN.
